<h1>Servo Motion</h1>
 <br>
When confronted with a rail junction, the servo has a choice of which direction to go.  <br>
If there is an <a href="/FzDocs/entrycontrol.html"><img class="items" src="/FzDocs/resources/factorization/textures/items/transparent_item.png" /> entry control</a> instruction, it will go that way. <br>
It will try to go in the direction pointed by  <a href="/FzDocs/setdirection.html"><img class="items" src="/FzDocs/resources/factorization/textures/items/transparent_item.png" /> set direction</a>. <br>
It prefers to go straight. <br>
It tries to go in the direction it was moving previously (this makes it zig-zag). For example, if it reaches a T intersection after a left turn, it will go right. <br>
If it can not go straight, then it will try to go up (relative to the servo). <br>
Failing that, it will go randomly choose right, left, or down (again, relative to the servo). <br>
It avoids going through a <a href="/FzDocs/entrycontrol.html"><img src="/FzDocs/resources/factorization/textures/textures/blocks/servo/entry_forbid.png" />forbidding entry control</a>; this is the second-to-last resort. <br>
It won't go backwards unless it is at a dead-end. <br>
Servos will not enter a rails if they have conflicting <a href="/FzDocs/servocolor.html">colors</a>. </body>
