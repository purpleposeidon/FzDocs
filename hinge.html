<h1>The Hinge</h1>
 <br>
This hinge contraption may be your best invention yet! It resembles an ordinary iron block when closed, but a narrow bolt of dark iron allows two heavy slabs to rotate up to a half-turn. <br>
When placed, one half of the hinge will be securely anchored to the world; blocks placed on the other half can rotate freely when pushed or pulled with an empty hand. <br>
Giving a good smack to the hinge block itself will make it slam shut. <br>
A redstone signal will lock the hinge in place. <br>
Comparators will measure how far open a hinge is. <br>
The heftiness of the hinge allows the construction of much grander doors than those rinky-dink wooden ones <img class="items" src="/FzDocs/resources/minecraft/textures/items/door_wood.png" />. <br>
Only the first block you place needs to be attached to the free end of the hinge; other blocks may be placed and removed however you desire, but no further than 8 blocks away from the hinge. <br>
 <br>
Hinged contraptions can be pulled open or closed using <a href="/FzDocs/winch.html">winches</a>. <br>
 <br>
Sockets and servos function on hinge like you would expect, for the most part. <br>
