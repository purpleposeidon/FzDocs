<h1>Twisted Block of Dark Iron</h1>
 <br>
Dark Iron is the only block in the known universe that can be bent against the alignment of reality with minimal fuss. Simply slap a sprocket on, and give it a twist! <br>
Other blocks can be placed against the dark iron block (up to a point), and the original block can be removed if desired. <br>
Placing a Twisted Block against another turned dark iron block will not, as some have feared, form a world-devlouring black hole; instead it will merely twist the original block slightly. It's perfectly safe! <br>
The same may not be true of all <i>other</i> blocks; it would be wise to keep bold experimentation well away from any planet you have fondness for. <br>
