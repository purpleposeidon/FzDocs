<h1>Goo</h1>
 <br>
Goo is a builder's swiss army knife! <br>
Right clicking a block with goo will put some goo on that block. Click on a block with goo on it to spread more goo around. Punch a gooey block to remove the goo from it, and the goo around it. Shift-punch a gooey block to remove just one goo. <br>
Mining a gooey block with the appropriate tool will mine out all of the other gooey blocks with it. <br>
The gooey blocks can be replaced by clicking on them with a different block. <br>
These two operations have a small chance of causing goo loss. <br>
Shift-clicking a goo-freey block with goo will move the other gooey blocks in that direction. <br>
Clicking & shift-clicking slabs and stairs with an empty hand will rotate them. <br>
