<h1>Servo Stacks</h1>
 <br>
Each servo has 2 lists of memory. You can see the contents of these lists by looking at the servo with an <a href="/FzDocs/lmp.html">LMP</a> handy. <br>
The left stack holds values; when instructions modify a stack, it is typically the left stack. <br>
The right stack holds instructions; the <a href="/FzDocs/instructions/subroutine.html">Subroutine</a> instruction will add other instructions to this stack. The instructions will be popped from the stack and executed until the stack is empty. <br>
