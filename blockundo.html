<h1>Blocks Placement Undo</h1>
 <br>
You can easily break the last six blocks you have recently placed. <br>
This makes it easy to fix misplaced blocks, particularly smoothstone, obsidian, and glass. <br>
You do not need the appropriate tool to break blocks in this manner. <br>
Some blocks, such as <img class="blocks" src="/FzDocs/resources/minecraft/textures/blocks/clay.png" /> Clay will not be broken in the silken manner as it is impossible to tell if that's what you actually want. Holding shift while breaking will force a silk touch. <br>
