<h1>The Barrel</h1>
 <br>
Barrels can store up to 64 stacks of a single item. So, a single barrel can store 4096 sticks, 64 swords, or 1024 eggs. <br>
Right clicking a barrel will store what you're holding, and left clicking removes a stack. Shift left clicking will remove a single item. Double right-clicking will fill the barrel from your inventory. <br>
 Barrels can have any direction and orientation. Clicking near the side edge of a block will place the barrel with its top pointing to that side. <br>
Items can only be extracted from the bottom of the barrel. Insertion is done from the top, or the back. <br>
There are a few variations of the standard barrel. <br>
The hopping barrel will pull one item from its above into it, and push one item out its bottom, at the same speed as a vanilla hopper. It also hops. A direct redstone signal will disable it. <br>
The silky barrel will hold its contents if it is broken with a silk-touch axe. <br>
The first item put into a sticky barrel gets stuck to the slime, and must be removed manually. <br>
 If you are under the influence of a Strength Potion, you can push barrels with a knockback sword. They can be pushed up stairs and slabs. <br>
