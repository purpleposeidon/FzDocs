<h1>The Compression Crafter</h1>
 <br>
The compression crafter is a powerful crafting machine. <br>
It crafts using blocks and barrels. It is built like a ring, with an inside area ranging from 3x3 to 1x1. The individual compression crafters must face inwards. It can be built flat, or vertically. <br>
It is activated with a redstone signal. There must be an inventory for the results of crafting to be output to. The side that recieves the redstone signal defines the bottom of the crafting grid. <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 Blocks can be converted to item form in different ways: <br>
<br> •The contents of barrels will be used as-is. 8 barrels full of cobblestone can be used to craft 32 furnaces in a single cycle. <br> •The item that a block drops can be used, as can the item dropped when mined with silk touch. A line of 3 smoothstone will make cobblestone slabs, but a 2x2 of smoothstone will make stone bricks. <br> •Finally, the block can be broken, and then uncrafted. Two wooden logs can be used to make 4 wooden pressure plates. <br>
 To craft a piston, three wooden logs, 4 smoothstone, a block of iron, and a block of redstone will make 1 piston, 9 planks, 8 iron, and 8 redstone. <br>
