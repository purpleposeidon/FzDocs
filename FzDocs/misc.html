Miscellaneous Nonsense is a sub-mod in Factorization that adds various tweaks &amp; polishes to vanilla Minecraft. <br>
<u>The '/f' client-side commands</u> <br>
Popular /f's include 'now', 'cl', and 'ss'. Run '/f list' for more information. <br>
<br>
 <u>Improved Projectile Physics</u> <br>
Projectiles now keep the velocity of their thrower, allowing them to conform to Newton's -- well-known and highly publicized -- First Law of Motion. (Implementation of the Third Law is still under construction.) <br>
This applies to snowballs, arrows, splash potions, and enderpearls. <br>
An important consequence of this is that you can survive a fall from a high place by throwing an enderpearl at the right time. <br>
<u>Buffed Nametags</u> Giving a mob a name with a nametag will buff their health. <br>
<u>Time Dilation</u> This is an optional setting that makes the client's tick rate match the server's. It can be enabled in the config file, or by using /f td. <br>
