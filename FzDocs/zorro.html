<h1>The Zorro Thing</h1>
 <br>
You. <br>
You're the bigshot. <br>
The man of the house. <br>
You do what needs to be done, and wipe that smirk off your face, junior. <br>
Who are you? The Hero. The Protagonist. <br>
And it is you who, with manly agency, <br>
kills bad guys, <br>
and kicks butt, <br>
and carves his mark on the wall, <br>
and settles old scores, <br>
and shot first, <br>
and has the plan he doesn't share, <br>
and knows that dame will be yours by the end of Act IV, <br>
and ignores the stupid rules and the big explosions, <br>
and holsters his gun with a flourish <br>
And then the Bad Guy, some nancy, sneers, "You've been watching too many action movies, Mr. Jones", but you coolly reply: "No. You just haven't watched enough," and drop out the window, 5 stories up, landing on your stead, for a clean getaway towards the horizon and the closing credits. <br>
<br>
 Do you hear what I'm saying? When you jump off a building and land on a horse, you'll be unhurt, and the lead will snap but you won't care, and if you fall exceptionally far, or with blade drawn, or while carying a baby, you might find your ride gets an even better boost. <br>
<br>
 But you already knew that. You knew that all along. </body>
