<h1>Parasieve</h1>
 <br>
The parasieve is a powerful device for filtering items into and out of inventories. Place the parasieve against an inventory. Any machine that attempts to access the parasieve will access that inventory through it. <br>
The parasieve's GUI will allow you to define up to 4 classes of items. Items that do not fit in one of the classes can not be inserted or extracted through the parasieve. The upper slot is used with bottom slot to determine the class. <br>
<br> •If no item classes are defined, then anything can pass the filter. <br> •If an item is alone, it will be matched exactly. <br> •If two items with different levels of damage are compared, then items within that quality may pass. <br> •If two items with text written on them are compared, then all similar items, with or without matching text, may pass. <br> •The parasieve may offer further discrimination based on characteristics invisible to the unaided eye. <br>
The parasieve can be used with comparators. They will count only items that can pass through the filter. <br>
Comparators can give more precise counts of items if a range is defined. <br>
For example, suppose a chest has a parasieve with 16 cobble in the 1st top slot, and 32 cobble in the 2nd bottom slot. If there is 16 or fewer cobble in the chest, then the comparator will will signal with strength of 1, and more than 32 cobble will output the strongest signal. <br>
Parasieves can be chained, up to a point. <br>
Applying a redstone signal will invert the filter. <br>
The parasieve can pass items to minecarts and servos. <br>
