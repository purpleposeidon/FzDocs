<h1>The Screw Pump</h1>
 <br>
The screwpump transfers liquids from behind it to in front of it. <br>
If there is a body of liquid behind it, it will drain from it. <br>
It can also drain from tanks. <br>
If there's a tank in front of the screwpump, then it will fill the tank. Otherwise it will flood into empty spaces, up to 7 blocks above the screw pump. Any tanks that are in the flooding area will be filled. </body>
