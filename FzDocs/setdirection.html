When a servo hits this instruction, it will attempt to go in the direction it is pointing. The direction can be changed by right-clicking with an <a href="/FzDocs/lmp.html">LMP</a>. <br>
If it can not actually go that way, it will at the next opportunity. (Unless it is later told to go in a different direction.) </body>
