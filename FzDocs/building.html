<h1>Building</h1>
 <br>
Several secret <a href="/FzDocs/vanillablocks.html">vanilla blocks</a> now have crafting recipes. <br>
Arbitrary shapes and statues can be built using <a href="/FzDocs/sculpture.html">Ceramic Sculpture</a>. <br>
<a href="/FzDocs/goo.html">Goo</a> is very helpful for construction and excavation. <br>
The "pick block" button (middle click) has been made more useful. If pick a block that is not on your hotbar, your inventory will be searched for that block, and, if found, it will be moved to your hotbar. <br>
Additionally, if you middle click smooth stone, and you have smooth stone in your inventory, then it will pull that block up if you have no cobblestone. This also applies to similar blocks. </body>
