<h1>The Furnace Heater</h1>
 <br>
The furnace heater simply heats up adjacent blocks. It can heat: <br> •Furnaces <br> •Slag Furnaces <br> •Crystallizers <br>
Multiple heaters can be used to decrease the time it takes to heat up and smelt faster. <br>
A single heater does not have enough wattage to heat multiple things simultaneously. <br>
 <br>
 <br>


<h1>The Slag Furnace</h1>
 The slag furnace is a furnace specialized for producing slightly more output than a regular furnace. It has two output slots, and consumes twice as much fuel as a normal furnace. <br>
It is necessary for extracting both silver and lead from galena ore. <br>


<h1>The Cystallizer</h1>
 <br>
This is a simple container in which crystals are grown. <br>
First, a solution is required; aqua regia is typically used here. Next, the material to be crystallized must be added. Then it must be heated up with a furnace heater, and then be left undisturbed for 20 minutes to allow the crystals to grow. <br>
It has six slots, one of which must contain the solution, which leaves 5 other slots availabe, which will be consumed in parallel. <br>
An important crystalline component is the <img class="items" src="/FzDocs/resources/factorization/textures/items/logic_matrix.png" /><br>
Logic Matrix, which are crystallized blocks of redstone. It would be wise to keep a stock of them prepared at all times. <br>


<h1>The Lacerator</h1>
 <br>
The lacerator is a <a href="/FzDocs/socket.html">Socket Tool</a> that grinds and destroys anything that is placed in front of it. <br>
It is built by placing a <img class="items" src="/FzDocs/resources/factorization/textures/items/motor.png" /><br>
Motor on a  <img class="blocks" src="/FzDocs/resources/factorization/textures/blocks/socket/face.png" /><br>
Socket Block, followed by a <img class="items" src="/FzDocs/resources/factorization/textures/items/diamond_cutting_head.png" /><br>
Diamond Cutting Head. <br>
It requires <a href="/FzDocs/charge.html">charge</a> to power its motor, and it needs an inventory behind itself to put its items into. <br>
If a mob or player steps in front of the spinning blades, they will get hurt. Mobs killed in this way have a small chance to drop XP. <br>
The lacerator will break blocks that are in front of it. How long it takes to break the block depends on that block's hardness. Two lacerators facing each-other with a block in between them will break the block especially quickly. <br>
Many blocks will be broken down when mined by the lacerator. For example, smoothstone becomes cobblestone, and iron ore becomes dirty iron gravel. <br>
The lacerator can not break barrels. Instead, it will process the contents of the barrel. This allows the lacerator to process things that aren't blocks, but this will usually be slower than breaking the actual blocks since the lacerator is optimized for stone-breaking, not wood-chopping. <br>
Items dropped by killed entities and broken blocks will be put into an internal buffer, which will be drained into the backing inventory. If the buffer can't be emptied, then the lacerator will become clogged and will stop operating. Punching a clogged lacerator will unclog it. <br>
A redstone signal will disable the lacerator. <br>
 <br>
 An issue of special mention is that lacerators mounted on <a href="/FzDocs/servo.html">servos</a> can break nearby <a href="/FzDocs/servorail.html">servo rail</a> when making turns. Here are two ways of dealing with this: <br> •Always keep the servo pointed outwards when making turns. This will keep it from facing the fragile servo rail. <br> •Use the <a href="/FzDocs/instructions/interact.html">Socket Powered</a> instruction to keep the lacerator safely disabled when it is not needed. <br>
