<h1>Sculpting</h1>
 <br>
A hand-made sculpture could be perfect for your home or dungeon. <br>
Craft a ball of clay onto a wooden slab, and then place it on the ground. <br>
This gives you a single lump of clay. Clicking on the lump with a clay ball will add another lump to the sculpture. <br>
To remove a clay lump, just break it like a normal block. If you sneak and break at the same time, you can pick up the entire sculpture. <br>
If you put the sculpture back down, you might find that it faces a different direction. This is because sculptures are always placed facing towards you, even the first time you placed it. <br>
<h2>Sculpting Tools</h2>
 Sticking a ball of clay on the end of a stick will make a sculpting tool. You only need one, but you may find it convenient to make multiples. <br>
The first sculpting tool is "Move".  Click with the tool on a clay lump to move it towards the side you clicked. Sneak-clicking will move it away. <br>
If you sneak-click the ground with "Move", the tool will turn into "Stretch". Clicking on a clay lump with "Stretch" will stretch it towards that side, and sneak-clicking will squish it away. <br>
Crafting "Move" by itself will give you the "Rotate" tool. Clicking on a clay lump with the tool to turn it, and sneak-clicking will turn it the other way. <br>
Crafting "Rotate" gives the "Reset Rotation" tool, which removes all rotation from the lump. <br>
Crafting "Reset Rotation" gives "Mold Sculpture". A sculpture that has been fired can be copied using the "Mold" tool. This requires a wooden plank, and an appropriate number of clay balls. "Mold Sculpture" crafts back into "Move". <br>
"Move", "Stretch", and "Rotate" can be stacked up to 4 times to multiply their effect. <br>

<h2>Drying and Firing</h2>
 If a sculpture is left alone for a while, or patted down with a piece of wool, it will dry out. It can't be reshaped when dry; clicking on it with a bucket of water will make it wet again. <br>
Dry clay is low-fired by placing the sculpture inside several furnace heaters. If the heaters has plenty of power, it will soon be fired. <br>
Once fired, the sculpture can be glazed by clicking each lump with a glaze bucket. Then it can be high fired. This can take an uncomfortably long time if there are not enough furnace heaters. <br>
<h2>Making Glazes</h2>
 Glazes are mixed in glaze buckets, and can be used 64 times before they run out. Most blocks can be used in mimicing glazes. Water and lava glazes can be crafted using its bucket with the base glaze. <br>
Mimicing glazes can be created by crafting the glaze with a block, or by clicking a block with a clean mimicing glaze. <br>
