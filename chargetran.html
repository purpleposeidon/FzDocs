<h1>Transfering Charge</h1>
 <br>
Charge is transfered using lead wiring. Any block that uses charge will conduct it amongst other blocks. This creates a network. Charge is distributed evenly among every block in the network. <br>
Machines that use charge generally have a threshold of charge that they require before they can start operating, and will regularly consume some while operating. <br>
