<h1>The Item Shifter</h1>
 <br>
The item shifter is a <a href="/FzDocs/socket.html">socket tool</a> that moves items to and from a block behind it into an inventory in front of it, such as a furnace, a minecart with a chest, or a servo. <br>
The item shifter has a few settings, which can be configured with an <a href="/FzDocs/lmp.html">LMP</a>. <br>
The direction of item flow can be controlled. By default, items are moved from the exporting inventory into the other. <br>
The operating mode of the shifter can be changed. There are three modes: <br> •Pulse Some Amount. In this mode, it will transer up to the specified number of items per redstone pulse. <br> •Pulse Exact Amount. The number of items to be moved can be specified. In this mode, if it can not move exactly that many items, then it will move no items. <br> •Stream Single Item. In this mode, it behaves like a hopper, except that it requires a steady redstone signal to operate. <br>
The transfer limit is how many items will be moved. In Stream Items mode, it is always one item at a time. <br>
The target slot controls which slot the item shifter will put items into. This applies to the inventory in front of it, not the backing inventory. It can be set to target either the entire inventory, or a specific slot. <br>
