<h1>Deprecation</h1>
 <br>
Perfection can not be created without destruction. <br>
<br>
 The Mixer and the Packager will be removed in 0.9, since the Compression Crafter can do everything that they can. Additional features will be added to make up for them. <br>
Charge transimission will be completely rewritten in 0.9, which might break wires. <br>
The Steam Turbine will be removed soon. <br>
