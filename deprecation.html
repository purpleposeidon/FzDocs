<h1>Deprecation</h1>
 <br>
A thing is not perfect until there is nothing left to remove. <br>
<br>
 The Mixer and the Packager will be removed in 0.9, since the Compression Crafter can do everything that they can. Additional features are being added to make up for them! <br>
Charge transimission will be completely rewritten in 0.9, which might require some rewiring, and maybe change generator yields. <br>
The Steam Turbine will be removed soon. <br>
Servos will lose their memory in the 0.9.100 release. You should make sure that you can easily reset your servo systems from a blank servo. <br>
Existing sculptures may not necessarily survive MC 1.8 <br>
