<h1>Building</h1>
 <br>
Factorization makes a few extra vanilla building blocks available for crafting. <br>
Firstly, the all-bark forms of certain woods are available. Crafting four logs in a shapeless recipe will create them. <br>
Non-vanilla logs may occasionally have all-bark recipes available. <br>
 <br>
 Flat sandstone can be made out of 2 sandstone pillars. <br>
Two stone slabs can be crafted together to make double half slabs, and two double half-slabs can make flat stone. <br>
 <br>
Four dirt can be combined to make dry dirt (also called Coarse Dirt), which grass will not spread to. <br>
