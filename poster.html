<h1><img class="items" src="/FzDocs/resources/factorization/textures/items/spawnPoster.png" />Poster</h1>
 <br>
Posters are much cooler than <img class="items" src="/FzDocs/resources/minecraft/textures/items/item_frame.png" />Item Frames. You can put them on most blocks, including buttons. Posters always fit nicely where you put them. <br>
An item can then be stuck to the poster, and it will cover up the entire poster. Clicking on the poster with a similar item will stretch the poster to be bigger; sneak-clicking will shrink it. <br>
Posters can be also be rotated by using another poster or an <a href="/FzDocs/lmp.html">LMP</a>. How they are rotated depends on whether you are looking at the poster from the side, or from straight on, and which tool you're using. <br>
Posters are more resistant to removal than item frames; you can take them down with a sneak-punch. Punching a poster will knock out changes made to it before it breaks. <br>
The poster will stay in place even if the block behind it has been removed, in defiance of ordinary physics. Take that, physics! <br>
