<h1>Servo Coloring</h1>
 <br>
<a href="/FzDocs/servo.html">Servos</a> and <a href="/FzDocs/servorail.html">servo rail</a> can be colored by placing some dye on them. <br>
Colored servos can travel on rails that have a matching color, and will completely ignore servo rails that do not match. <br>
Uncolored servos can travel on colored rails, and colored servos can travel on uncolored rails. </body>
