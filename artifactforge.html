<h1>The Artifact Forge</h1>
 <br>
The Artifact Forge is a special anvil that lets you create powerful artifacts. However, artificry is not easy! First, you must wait for inspiration. This only happens about twelve times per year. <br>
... <br>
Hopefully you'll stick around long enough. <br>
There are several materials that are absolutely required for creating artifacts. <br>
First, you need two identical tools. <br>
You will also need  uthree Bottles of Potency, which are created by combining an empty bottle and a bit of <img class="items" src="/FzDocs/resources/factorization/textures/items/entheas.png" />entheas in an <img class="blocks" src="/FzDocs/resources/minecraft/textures/blocks/anvil_base.png" />anvil for 35 levels. Be warned that if you die, any bottles of potency that you have made will be ruined. Also, bottles of potency are personal to each and every artificer, and so can not be shared. <br>
You will need at least one enchanted book to apply to the tool; up to 8 enchanted books can be used. All artifacts get one level of Unbreaking for free, but this does not count towards the enchanted book requirement. <br>
Lastly, you will need to think of a name for the artifact. It is of critical importance that the name be totally awesome, or else it may all blow up in your face. <br>
By combining all of these things together, you will complete your masterpiece, and its name will ring out for all to hear. <br>
 There are some other optional abilities of the artifact forge. <br>
The name of the artifact can be set by using a dye. (The dye may color the name in unexpected ways.) <br>
A lore can be added to the tool, which will show up below in purple text. If the lore is especially long, you will want to manually break it up onto separate lines by using a '|'. <br>
When combining tools, any enchants on them will be merged, bypassing the usual enchantment level cap (up to a point). This can be done with tools that were also made on the artifact forge, allowing for the creation of extremely powerful and extremely expensive artifacts. <br>
Once an artifact is nearly broken, it can be submitted to the <a href="/FzDocs/legendarium.html">Hall of Legends</a> to be repaired. Some artifacts may be cheap enough to repair at an anvil. <br>
