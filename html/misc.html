<p>...and lots of other things.</p>

<h2>UI Improvements</h2>

<p>When Minecraft starts up, Misc Nonsense will play a clicking noise.
This is handy when you've got 100 mods installed and it takes 10 minutes to load.</p>

<p>Pick block, usually bound to the middle click key, will search your inventory for matching blocks,
and it will also match the broken form of a block.</p>
