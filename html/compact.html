<h1>Compression Crafter</h1>

<p>(Picture of a CompACT system goes here...)</p>

<p>The Compression Crafter (CompACT) is a crafting system that uses blocks, in the world, rather than items in an inventory.
It is a mutli-block structure.
The crafting grid size can range from 1x1 (using 4 CompACT blocks) to 3x3 (using 12 CompACT blocks).</p>

<p>The CompACT blocks must be placed around the desired crafting area, with the blue grids facing inwards.
To activate crafting, a redstone signal must be applied to a CompACT block,
and that block must be adjacent to an inventory to output the crafting results.</p>

<p>It can convert blocks into items in a few different ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>If it is a barrel, it'll use the barrel's contents</li>
<li>It will try to use the block exactly as it is (not unlike silk touch)</li>
<li>It will use the broken form of the block (eg, smooth stone used as cobblestone)</li>
<li>It will break the block, and use the output of crafting it by itself (eg, wood log used as wooden planks)</li>
</ol>

<p>If crafting with barrels, it can pull up to 32 items at once for one craft.
The crafted form of a block can also be used to craft multiple items at once;
9 being typical for metal storage blocks.</p>

<p>If crafting fails, it may be because the CompACT is looking at the crafting grid at a different angle.</p>
